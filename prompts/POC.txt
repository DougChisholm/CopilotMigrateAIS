Update the plan to include a Proof of Concept step, which you will help build using the existing Integration files we have (in this case the Boomi files and settings found in the bpr folder). Create sub issues for each step you take then assign yourself to each sub issue in turn to add any infrastructure as code and executable code needed to fulfil the POC aspect. Create a DEPLOY.md file explaining how to deploy it to azure and include a deploy button that will actually deploy it safely to a sandbox environment. Abstract away any keys or tokens needed so they can be separated using environment variables or equivalent. If you need more information or any files or setting values, please add a sub-issue listing what you need.

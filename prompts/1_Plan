Create a plan to migrate a systems integration currently built in Boomi over to Azure Integration services architecture. Use the specifications and sizing found in the specifications folder and any information or links in the knowledge folder. Use the boomi files in the bpr folder to understand what the integration does. Include the steps you would expect a team to perform and the mount of time it might take for a single simple integration between two systems. Add this plan to the repository as plan.md file.
